\title{Five Dimensional Algebraic Tori}



\begin{document}
\maketitle
\abstract{The rationality problem for algebraic tori is well known. It is known
 that any algebraic torus is unirational over its field of definition. The first
  purpose of this work is to solve rationality problem for 5 dimensional stably 
  rational algebraic tori with an indecomposable character lattice. In order to 
  do so, we have studied the associated character lattices of the mentioned 
  algebraic tori. For each character lattice $L$, either we see the lattice as 
  an associated lattice to a root system (of which rationality of its corresponding 
  algebraic torus is known) or we find a reduced component of $L$ so that we can 
  relate rationality of the associated algebraic torus to lower dimensions. Using 
  these two main methods from \cite{Nicole1}, we solve rationality problem in some cases.}
\section{Introduction}
An interesting problem in algebraic geometry is the rationality problem, i.e. 
for a given algebraic variety, determine if it is rational or not. Naturally 
this is a difficult problem to solve. Hence it makes sense to consider some 
relaxed notions of rationality. 

An algebraic $F$-variety $X$ is called rational if there exists a birational map 
form $X$ to $\mathbb{A}^n$ for some $n$. Algebraically $X$ is rational if 
the rarional function field of $X$ is $F$-rational, i.e. it is a purely 
transcendental extension of $F$. $X$ is called stably rational if $X \times 
\mathbb{A}^n$ is rational. Similarly one can say $X$ is stably rational if 
a purely transcendental extension of the rational function field of $X$ is 
rational. Finally $X$ is called unirational if the rational function field of 
$X$ is a subfield of a purely transcendental extension of $F$. Geometrically 
this means there exist a dominant rational map from $\mathbb{A}^n$ to $X$ for
some $n$. 

It can be seen that rationality implies stable rationality and the later implies 
unirationality. It is well-known that none of the converses of these implications
hold in general for varieties. 

Assume $X$ is a quasi projective $F$-variety. A $F$-variety $Y$ is called an 
$F$-form of $X$ if $X \otimes_k \bar{F} \cong Y$. A $d$-dimensoinal algebraic 
$F$-torus is a $F$-form of $\mathbb{G}_m^d$.

In the case of algebraic tori, we know that all of them are unirational. 
Moreover there exists a famous conjecture by Voskeresenskii,
which states that, any stably rational algebraic torus is rational. To the 
best of the authors knowledge the conjucture is still open. 

There is a one-to-one coresspondence between the isomorphism classes of 
$n$ dimensional algebraic $F$-tori and representations of $G_F = Gal(F_s/F)$ 
into $GL(n,\Z)$, where $F_s$ is the seperable closure of $F$. It is understood 
that there exist a finite Galois extension of $F$, say $K$, such that 
$T \otimes_F K \cong \mathbb{G}_{m}^n$. The smalles such Galois extensoin 
(resp. Galois group) is called the splitting field (resp. splitting group)
 of $T$.
 
The isomorphism classes of $n$ dimensional algebraic $F$-tori are in bijection 
with conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of $GL(n,\Z)$. We know that the number 
of these finite subgroups up to conjugacy is finite. If $G \leq GL(n,\Z)$ then 
the standard lattice, $L = <e_i: 1 \leq i \leq n>_\Z$ where $e_i = [\delta_{1i}]$,
with the action (right multiplication) of $G$ defines a $\Z G$ lattice $L_G$. 
Assume $K/F$ is a finite Galois extension with $G = Gal(K/F)$. Now $T_G = K(L_G)^G$
is and algebraic torus. Note that conjugate groups correspond to isomorphic 
lattices and hence are associated to isomorphic algebraic tori. Conversley for 
a given $n$-dimensional algebraic torus $T$, which is defined over $F$ and split 
by $K$, its character group is a $\Z G$ lattice of rank $n$ and hence associates 
to a conjugacy class of subgroups of $GL(n,\Z)$.  

In the case of algebraic tori, we know that all of them are unirational. 
Moreover there exists a famous conjecture by Voskeresenskii,
which states that, any stably rational algebraic torus is rational. To the 
best of the authors knowledge the conjucture is still open. During the 60's and
afterwards there was a substantional amount of work in rationality problem 
for algebraic tori, which is mainly done by Voskeresenskii, Endo, Miyata, Saltman, 
Sansuc and colliet-thelene. Their approach to address the problem was the
correspondence between algebraic tori and $G$-lattices. Their efforts led to 
characterization of stably rational and retract rational algebraic tori based 
on their character lattices.

Voskeresenskii proved that any two dimensional algebraic torus is rational. 
In early 90's Kunyavski classified three dimensional algebraic tori up to 
rationality. He showed that except for 15 three dimensional algebraic tori 
which are not retract rational, the rest of them are rational.

In 2012 Hoshi and Yamasaki published a paper \cite{Hoshi} in which they 
classified algebraic tori of dimensions 4 and 5 up to stable rationality. 
Their classification is based on computing the flasque classes of algebraic 
tori in GAP. They showed that in rank 5,  there are exactly 311 indecomposable 
$G$-lattices which are stably rational.  More precisely they showed their 
stable rationality by finding the maximal groups and proved stable rationality 
of their subgroups. The following table presents the maximal groups they found.

\end{table}
\noindent
In 2015 Lemire \cite{Nicole1}, proved that, except for possibly ten of the 
4 dimensional stably rational algebraic tori found by Hoshi and Yamasaki, 
all of them are rational. The rationality of the ten exceptional cases is 
still unknown. The author did not use any computer based arguments except 
for finding generating sets of groups and lattices of subgroups in GAP. The 
rationality results we are presenting are based on the ideas used in \cite{Nicole1}. 
We present algorithms which may be applied to character lattices of algebraic 
tori, in order to investigate their rationality. These algorithms provide 
machinery to reduce the rationality problem in a specific dimension to lower dimensions.\\
\\
From now on we will call the groups mentioned in Table \ref{tbl:18Max} 
respectively $G_1$ to $G_{18}$. $L_G$ represents the corresponding $G$-lattice 
to a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$, $G$, as defined in Definition 
\ref{Assumption}. When we say a group or a lattice is rational we mean their 
corresponding algebraic torus is rational. By a decomposable (matrix) group, 
we mean its corresponding lattice is decomposable. We say $G'$ is the dual 
group of $G$ if $G'$ is the corresponding group to the dual of $L_G$.  \\
\\
In this chapter we will investigate the rationality of $G_1, \ldots ,  G_{18}$. 
In some cases, we prove that the group is hereditarily rational. There are two 
main methods that we will use, both of which were used in \cite{Nicole1}. The 
first method is reducing the rationality of a five dimensional torus to rationality 
in lower dimensions. The second one is to see them as lattices of which the rationality is known.

\section{$G$-Lattices}\label{G-Lattices}
It is known that there is a duality between algebraic tori and \glat s. In order to be able to discuss the duality, we briefly introduce \glat s in this section. For a more detailed discussion see \cite[Chapters 1 and 2]{Lorenz}.\\ \\
A lattice is a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module of finite rank. As a $\Z$-module, it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for some $n$. If we have a group $G$, we can endow the lattice with an action of $G$. If $G$ acts on a lattice $L$ by automorphisms i.e. there exists $$ G \longrightarrow GL(M) \cong \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{Z}),$$ 
we say $L$ is a $G$-lattice. We can equivalently say that $\G$-lattices are free $\Z$-modules of finite rank which is also $\mathbb{Z}[G]$-modules, for $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ the integral group ring over $G$. A $G$-equivariant, $ \mathbb{Z}$-linear map between $G$-lattices is called a homomorphism of $G$-lattices.\\
\\For a given \glat \, $L$ we define $$ L^\G = \lbrace l \in L : g.l=l,  \,\, \,\,  \forall g \in \G \rbrace. $$

Now let $R$ be an arbitrary commutative (unital) ring. For any \glat  \, $L$ we can form the group algebra $R[L]$ and the action of $G$ on $L$ can be extended to an action on $R[L]$. The subalgebra of all $G$-invariant elements in $R[L]$ $$ R[L]^ \G = \lbrace l \in R[L] : g.l = l, \,\,\, \forall g \in \G \rbrace$$ is called the multiplicative invariant algebra. Studying this algebra is the subject of multiplicative invariant theory. 
\\
\\
The group algebra $R[L]$ of a \glat , is isomorphic to the Laurent polynomial algebra \linebreak $R[x_1^{\pm 1}, x_2^{\pm 1}, \ldots , x_n^{\pm 1}] $ and the lattice itself becomes a multiplicative subgroup of all monomials.
\\
\\
If $L$ and $L'$ are two \glat  s then $\mathrm{Hom}_{\Z}(L,L')$, the set of all $\Z$-linear maps from $L$ to $L'$, is a \glat \,\, with the following action $$ (g.f)(m) = g.(f(g^{-1}.m)).$$
For $L'=\Z$ (with trivial action of $G$), we get the \glat \,\,  $L^* = \mathrm{Hom}_{\Z}(L,\Z)$ which is called the dual lattice of $L$.\\
\\Suppose $L$ is a $G$-lattice and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. $L$ can be considered as an $H$-lattice. The new $H$-lattice is called restricted and is denoted by $L\downarrow^G_H$.\\
\\Assume $H$ is a finite index subgroup of $G$ and $L$ is an $H$-lattice. The $G$ module $\Z[H] \otimes_{\Z[G]} L$ is a $G$-lattice which is called the induced $G$-lattice and is denoted by $L\uparrow_H^G$. 
\begin{definition}
A \glat \,\, $L$ is called a permutation lattice if there exists a $\Z$ -basis $X$ for $L$ such that, $G$ acts as permutation group on $X$. We denote $L$ by $\Z[X]$.
\end{definition}
%\begin{example} Let $H$ be a finite index subgroup of a group $G$ and $G/H =\lbrace g_1H,g_2H, \ldots , g_nH \rbrace$ be a complete representative set of left cosets of $H$ in $G$. Then $ \Z [G/H]$ is a $G$-lattice with the action $g.g_iH = (gg_i)H$. It is easy to see that $G$ acts as a permutation group on the basis so it is a permutation lattice.
%\end{example}
%It is known that the permutation $G$-lattice $\Z[G/H]$ is isomorphic to $\Z\uparrow_H^G$.
%\begin{lemma}\cite[Proposition 10.28]{Curtis}
%If $L$ is a $H$-lattice and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ of finite index, then $$L^*\uparrow_H^G \cong (L\uparrow_H^G)^*.$$
%\end{lemma} 
%\begin{lemma}\cite[Section 2.2]{Lorenz}
% A \glat \,$L$ is a permutation lattice if and only if $ L \cong \bigoplus_H \Z [\G/H]$ where $H$ is a finite index subgroup of $G$.
%\end{lemma}
%\noindent
%Since the trivial $H$-lattice $\Z$ is self dual, as a corollary of the above lemmas we can conclude that, any permutation lattice is self dual.\\
%\\
%It is important to notice that direct sum (and tensor product) of permutation lattices is still permutation.
\begin{definition}
We call a \glat \,$L$, decomposable if there are nontrivial \glat s $L_1$ and $ L_2$ such that $ L\cong L_1 \oplus L_2$. $L$ is called indecomposable if it is not decomposable.
\end{definition}
\noindent
If $L$ is decomposable then it is reducible, but the converse is not true for lattices.
\begin{definition}
A \glat \,$L$ is called reducible if $L$ has a nontrivial $G$-invariant subspace $M$ such that $L/M$ is torsion free. $L$ is called irreducible if it is not reducible. 
\end{definition}
%\noindent
%Now let $L$ and $L'$ are two \glat s. $L$ and $L'$ are stably permutation equivalent if and only if there exist permutation lattices $P$ and $P'$ such that $$ L \oplus P \cong L' \oplus P'.$$
%In fact the above notion defines an equivalence relation on \glat s. We denote the equivalence class of $L$ by $[L]$.
%\begin{definition}
%A \glat \,$L$ is called stably permutation if $[L] = [0]$ i.e. there exist permutation lattices $P$ and $P'$ such that $$L \oplus P \cong P'$$
%\end{definition}
%\noindent
%We can also define addition on the set of all equivalence classes of stably permutation equivalence relation. For $G$-lattices $L$ and $L'$, define $$ [L] + [L'] = [L \oplus L'] $$ Note that it is well defined.\\
%\\
%Having this addition on the set of equivalence classes turns the set to an additive monoid which we denote it by $\mathrm{SP}_{\G}$. This is obviously a commutative monoid with [0] as the identity.
%\begin{definition}
%A \glat \,is called permutation projective or invertible if its corresponding class in $\mathrm{SP}_\G$ is invertible. i.e. there exists an $L'$ such that $ [L] +[L']=[0]$.
%\end{definition}
%\noindent
%The above definition says, there are $P$ and $P'$ permutation lattices such that $ L \oplus L' \oplus P \cong P' $. So $L$ is invertible if and only if $L$ is a direct summand of a permutation lattice.\\
%\\ 
%Let $G$ be a finite group. Let us denote the Tate cohomology functor by $\hat{H}^i(G,.)$ (for $i \in \Z$) (See \cite[Chapter 6]{Brown}). Here we are just interested in  $\hat{H}^{\pm 1}(G,.)$. 
%%We know that $\hat{H}^{ i}(G,.) = H^{ i}(G,.)$ for $i>0$. For a \glat \,\,$L$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$ we can see $\hat{H}^{- 1}(H,L)$ as below $$ \hat{H}^{-1}(H,L) = L(H)/[H,L]$$  Where $$ [H,L] = \sum_{g \in H} [g,L], \,\,\,\, [g,L]= \lbrace g(l)-l : l \in L \rbrace, \,\,\,\, L(H) = \lbrace l \in L : \sum_{h \in H} h(l)=0 \rbrace.$$
% \begin{definition}
% A \glat \,$L$ is $\hat{H}^i$- trivial if $\hat{H}^{i}(H,L) = 0$  for all $H \leqslant \G$.
% \end{definition}
%\begin{definition}
%We  call a \glat \,$L$, flasque (coflasque) if it is $\hat{H}^{-1}$- trivial ($\hat{H}^1$- trivial).
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{lemma}\cite[Page 36]{Lorenz}
%Let $L$ be a \glat \,\,then $$ \hat{H}^i(\G, L) \cong \hat{H}^{-i}(\G , L^*).$$
%\end{lemma}
%
%%\begin{lemma}
%%Let L be an invertible \glat \,\, , then for all $H \leqslant G$ $$ \hat{H}^1(H, L) = \hat{H}^{-1}(H , L)=0.$$
%%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{definition}
%An exact sequence of \glat s $$ 0 \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow P \longrightarrow F \longrightarrow 0$$ is called a flasque resolution of $L$, if $P$ is a permutation lattice and $F$ is flasque. Similarly, we can define a coflasque resolution of $L$ as  $$ 0 \longrightarrow C \longrightarrow P \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow 0$$ where $C$ is coflasque.
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{theorem}\cite[Lemma 2.6.1]{Lorenz}
%For any given \glat \,\,$L$, there exists a coflasque (flasque) resolution. Furthermore, if $$ 0 \longrightarrow C \longrightarrow P \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow 0$$ and  $$ 0 \longrightarrow C' \longrightarrow P' \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow 0$$ are two coflasque resolutions of $L$, then $[C]=[C']$ (statement is true for flasque resolutions).
%\end{theorem}
%\begin{lemma}\cite[Lemma 2.5.1]{Lorenz}
%Permutation projective \glat s are both flasque and coflasque.
%\end{lemma}
%\noindent
%We can see that in particular permutation lattices are flasque and coflasque.
%As an example one can consider the augmentation map \begin{center}
%$\varepsilon_{\G/H}:\Z[\G/H] \rightarrow \Z$
%\end{center}
%\begin{center}
%$gH \rightarrow 1$
%\end{center}
%Let $I_{\G/H} = Ker \varepsilon_{\G/H}$. We can obtain the below exact sequence $$ 0 \rightarrow I_{\G/H} \xrightarrow{i}  \Z[\G/H] \xrightarrow{\varepsilon_{\G/H}} \Z \rightarrow 0.$$
%Considering the dual sequence where $J_{\G/H}= I_{\G/H}^*$ we get 
%$$ 0 \rightarrow \Z \rightarrow \Z[\G/H] \rightarrow J_{\G/H}  \rightarrow 0.$$
%Note that \Z \, and $ \Z[\G/H]$ are both flasque and coflasque.\\
%\\
%In general there is a construction for finding a coflasque resolution of a given lattice $L$. Let $$ P = \bigoplus_H L^H \uparrow^G_H. $$
%where $H$ ranges through all subgroups of $G$. It can be shown that $P$ is a permutation \glat \,\,. On the other hand we can extend the inclusion $$ L^H \rightarrow L$$ to a $G$-equivariant epimorphism $$ \phi:P\twoheadrightarrow L$$ with $\phi (P^H)= L^H$ for all $H\leq \G$.
%Now letting $C= \mathrm{ker} \phi$ we obtain an exact sequence
%$$ 0 \rightarrow C \rightarrow P \rightarrow L \rightarrow 0.$$
%Still we need to check if $C$ is a coflasque \glat .
%By applying the cohomology functor to the above sequence we get
%$$\cdots \rightarrow P^H \rightarrow L^H \rightarrow H^1(H,C)\rightarrow H^1(H,P) \rightarrow \cdots$$
%But we know that $H^1(H,P)=0$. Since $\phi$ is a surjection from $P^H$ to $L^H$, we conclude that $H^1(H,C)=0$.
%\begin{definition} 
%Let $L$ be a \glat . The flasque class of $L$, which is denoted by $[L]^{fl}$ is $[F] \in \mathrm{SP}_{\G}$ where $F$ is the cokernel in any flasque resolution of $L$.
%\end{definition}
%\noindent
%We write $$ L \sim _{fl} L' \Longleftrightarrow [L]^{fl} = [L']^{fl}$$
%Note that $[0]^{fl} = [0]$ and $[L \oplus L']^{fl} = [L]^{fl}+[L']^{fl}$, since the direct sum of two flasque resolutions for $L$ and $L'$ is a flasque resoulution for $ L \oplus L'$.
%\begin{definition}
%A \glat \,\,$L$ which $ L \sim_{fl} 0$ is called quasi-projective i.e. $L$ is quasi projective if and only if there exists a flasque resolution for L $$ 0 \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow P \longrightarrow Q \longrightarrow 0$$ where Q is a permutation $G$-lattice.
%\end{definition} 
%\noindent
%In order to summarize important facts about lattices we can mention the below diagram

\section{GAP: Carat and CrystCat}
GAP \cite{GAP4} stands for Groups, Algorithms, Programming, and is a computer 
algebra system for computations in discrete algebra with emphasis on computations 
in group theory. GAP is an open source system which is accessible directly or 
in SAGE \cite{sagemath}. GAP provides various packages for computations in matrix 
groups and representation theory. For our purposes we need Carat and CrystCat packages of GAP.\\
\\
The GAP package Carat provides functions of the stand-alone programs of $CARAT$, 
which is a package for the computations related to crystallographic groups. Carat 
contains the catalog of all conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ 
for $n$ up to six. More precisely the Carat package gives access to all 
$\Q$-classes and $\Z$-classes and maximal classes over $\Z$ (for the number of 
these classes see Table \ref{tbl:Carat}).  
\begin{remark}
The $\Q$-classes are conjugacy classes over $\Q$. We note that some $\Z$-classes 
may belong to the same conjugacy class over the rationals.
\end{remark}
%\begin{table}[H]
%\centering
%\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
%\hline
% & \# conjugacy classes  & \# conjugacy classes & \# conjugacy classes \\
% $ n$ & of finite subgroups & of maximal finite  & of finite subgroups\\
%		 &  of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$& subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ & over $\Q$\\
% \hline
% 1 & 2& 1 & 2\\
% 2 & 13& 2 & 10\\
% 3 & 73& 4 & 32\\ 
%  4 & 710 & 9 & 227\\
%  5 & 6079& 17 & 955\\
% 6 & 85308& 39 & 7103\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\caption{Numbers of conjugacy classes which are accessible in Carat.}
%\label{tbl:Carat}
%\end{table}
%\noindent
It is worth mentioning that Carat contains information about crystallographic groups 
which we will not use. The CrystCat Package in GAP also provides a catalog of 
crystallographic groups up to dimension 4. The catalog mostly covers the data in 
\cite{Crystallography}. CrystCat and Carat are complement of each other. \\
\\
The GAP ID, $(n,m,l,k)$ of a finite subgroup $G$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ means that 
$G$ is of rank $n$ and belongs to $k$-th $\Z$ class of the $l$-th $\Q$-class of the 
$m$-th crystal system. This works for $2\leq n \leq 4$. Hoshi and Yamasaki wrote 
a GAP code using the Carat package to have easy access to the $j$-th $\Z$-class 
of the $i$-th $\Q$-class group of rank $n$. They called this Carat ID. The GAP 
scripts written by Hoshi and Yamasaki are available from
\begin{center}
http://www.math.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~yamasaki/Algorithm/
\end{center}
The algorithms introduced in the next section are implemented in GAP (needs some 
functions from the codes written by Hoshi and Yamasaki) and the code is available from
\begin{center}
https://github.com/armin-jamshidpey/Algebraic-Tori
\end{center}
Since the actions of matrix groups in GAP are considered from right, throughout 
this chapter we work with row vectors instead of columns. One may also use the 
columns by considering the dual groups.

\section{Well-Known Rationality Results}
In this section we present some important results about rationality problem for 
algebraic tori. Before presenting the results we need the following definition 
to avoid repeating the same assumptions.
\begin{definition}\label{Assumption}
If $G$ is a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$, then the corresponding lattice 
to $G$ which is denoted by $L_G$ is the rank $n$ lattice generated by the standard 
basis, i.e. $L_G = \langle e_i : i  = 1, \ldots, n \rangle_\Z$ where $(e_i)_j = \delta_{ij}$. 
The action of $G$ on $L_G$ is given by multiplication from right on the $e_i$'s.
 Moreover, if $G \cong \mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$ for some finite Galois extension $K/F$ 
 then $K[L_G] \cong K[x^{\pm 1}_1, \ldots , x^{\pm 1}_n]$, that is the Laurent 
 polynomial ring, and $K(L_G)$ which is the quotient field of $K[L_G]$ is isomorphic 
 to $K(x_1, \ldots , x_n)$ ($x_i$'s are algebraically independent over $K$) are equipped 
 with an action of $G$ as
\begin{itemize}
\item $G$ acts as Galois group on $K$ 
\item $\forall g \in G, \,\,\, g(x_i) = \prod_{j=1}^{j=n} x_j^{a_{ij}}$  where $a_{ij}$'s 
are given by $g(e_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{j=n} a_{ij}e_j$.
\end{itemize}
Also $T_G$ is the corresponding algebraic torus to $L_G$ i.e. $T_G$ is an algebraic 
torus defined on $F$ which splits over $K$, with character lattice $L_G$. 
\end{definition}
\noindent
By the duality explained before, $K(L_G)^G$ is the rational function field of $T_G$. 
From now on we work with finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ (up to conjugacy) and 
when we consider their corresponding lattice (or algebraic torus), $L_G$ ($T_G$), we 
mean the lattice (algebraic torus) defined in Definition \ref{Assumption}.

\begin{theorem}\cite{Speiser}\label{NoNameLemma}
(No Name Lemma) Let $M$ be a permutation \glat \,\,and $F$ be a \G-field. Then $F(M)^\G$ 
is rational over $F^\G$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\lbrace x_1, \ldots , x_n \rbrace$ be a $\Z$-basis which is permuted by $G$ and 
$V = \sum^n_{i=1}Fx_i$ be a $F$ vector space. Applying Proposition \ref{Speiser'sLemma} 
to $V$, we find $y_1, \ldots , y_n \in V^G $ such that $V = \sum^n_{i=1}Fy_i$. This 
implies $F(M) = F(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = F(y_1, \ldots, y_n)$. Hence 
$$F(M)^G = F(y_1, \ldots , y_n)^G = F^G(y_1, \dots, y_n).$$ 
\end{proof}
\noindent
Note that if $\G = \mathrm{Gal} (F/K)$, then $F^\G = K$. For a constructive proof see 
\cite{Armin}, also a more general version of the No Name Lemma see \cite{Domokos}.
\begin{theorem}\cite[Proposition 9.5.1]{Lorenz}\label{SignPermRational}
Assume $L$ is a sign permutation $G$-lattice and $F$ is a $G$-field. Then $F(M)^G$ 
is rational over $F^G$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
The rationality problem for algebraic tori of dimension one was concrete. For 
dimension two Voskresenskii used a geometric method to prove the below result. 
\begin{theorem}
\cite{Vos67} Any 2 dimensional algebraic torus over k, is k-rational.
\end{theorem} 
\noindent
We talked about the duality between category of algebraic tori and category of \glat . 
Having the duality in hand one may ask how to interpret the notions from one side to 
the other side. One of the important results about translating the facts about the 
rationality of algebraic tori, into the language of \glat s is given below.
\begin{theorem}\cite{Vos74}
Let $M$ and $M'$ be two \glat s  and F/K be a finite Galois extension with Galois 
Group \G . Then $[M]^{fl}=[M']^{fl}$ if and only if $ F(M)^\G $ and $ F(M')^\G$ are 
stably isomorphic.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
The next two results give us necessary and sufficient conditions for stable rationality 
and retract rationality in terms of \glat  s. Having these two criteria gives us some 
control over the birational classification of algebraic tori of small dimension.
\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem 9.5.4]{Lorenz} Let M be a \glat \,
and $F/K$ be a finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. $[M]^{fl}$ is invertible 
if and only if $F(M)^\G$ is retract $K$-rational.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem 1.6]{EndoMiyata}Let M be a \glat \,\, 
and F/K be a finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. $[M]^{fl}=0$ if and only if  
$F(M)^\G$ is stably K-rational.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
The above two theorems can be used to see any stably rational algebraic torus is retract 
rational.\\
\\
The following two theorems classifies algebraic tori of dimension 4 and  5 up to stable 
rationality. In \cite{Hoshi} the authors gave a complete classification of mentioned tori, 
however they did not say anything about rationality of tori of dimension 4 and 5. The 
main idea of their work was to investigate the last 3 results above, by means of computer 
algebra system, GAP. 
\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem 1.9]{Hoshi}
Let F/K be a finite Galois extension with Galois Group $\G \leqslant \mathrm{GL}(4, \Z)$. 
Assume $G$ acts on $L = F(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ as above. (For tables of the below subgroups 
see \cite[Page 4]{Hoshi})
\\ 
(i) $L^\G$ is stably K-rational if $G$ is (up to conjugacy) one of a list of 487 
subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(4,\Z)$.
\\ 
(ii)  $L^\G$ is not stably but retract K-rational if $G$ is (up to conjugacy) one 
of a list of 7 subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(4,\Z)$.
\\
(iii) $L^\G$ is not retract K-rational if G is (up to conjugacy) one of a list of 
216 subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(4,\Z)$.
 \end{theorem}
 \noindent
In 2015, Lemire showed that except for possibly ten, all stably rational groups found 
by Hoshi and Yamasaki are rational (see \cite{Nicole1}).
\begin{theorem}\label{H}\cite[Theorem 1.12]{Hoshi}
Let F/K be a finite Galois extension with Galois Group $\G  \leqslant \mathrm{GL}(5, \Z)$. 
Assume G acts on $L = F(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)$ as above. (for tables of below subgroups see 
\cite[Pages 134-144]{Hoshi})
\\ 
(i) $L^\G$ is stably K-rational if G is (up to conjugacy) one of a list 3051 subgroups 
of $\mathrm{GL}(5,\Z)$.
\\ 
(ii)  $L^\G$ is not stably but retract K-rational if G is (up to conjugacy) one of a list 
25 subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(5,\Z)$.
\\
(iii) $L^\G$ is not retract K-rational if G is (up to conjugacy) one of a list of 3003 
subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(5,\Z)$.
 \end{theorem}
 \noindent
There are examples of varieties which are stably rational but not rational. So in general 
being stably rational is not the same as being rational. However, there is a conjecture 
about the equivalence of stable rationality and rationality for algebraic tori.\\ \\
 \textbf{Conjecture}. \cite[Section 2.6.1]{Voskresenskii} Any stably rational algebraic 
 torus is rational.\\

% \section{Research Problem}
According to Theorem \ref{H} we know all stably rational algebraic tori of dimension 5. 
However, the theorem does not say anything about rationality of those tori. An interesting 
problem is to find all rational tori between 3051 mentioned tori in the theorem.\\
\\

We call $\G \leq \mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ irreducible (resp. indecomposable), if the corresponding 
lattice to $G$ be irreducible (resp. indecomposable).
\\
 
\section{Families of Rational Algebraic Tori}
In the next chapter, we investigate on rationality of stably rational algebraic tori 
of dimension 5.  We will try to reduce their rationality to the rationality of some 
well understood algebraic torus. In this small section we present some families of 
algebraic tori which are rational, so that we can relate our algebraic tori to one 
of these families. It is already mentioned that every $n$ dimensional algebraic torus 
has a corresponding finite subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$. In order to study the 
rationality of algebraic tori, we study its corresponding group. We would rather to 
consider maximal groups and prove rationality for their subgroups, instead of proving 
it case by case. The following definitions are borrowed from \cite{Nicole1}.

\begin{definition}
Let $L$ be a $G$-lattice for $G\leq \mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$. If all algebraic tori with 
character lattice $L\downarrow_H^G$ and splitting group $H$ are rational, for any 
subgroup $H \leq G$, then we call $L$ hereditarily rational. 
\end{definition} 
\begin{definition}
If $T$ is an algebraic torus and $L$ is its corresponding lattice, then $T$ is called 
hereditarily rational if $L$ is hereditarily rational.
\end{definition}
\noindent
By Theorem \ref{NoNameLemma}, a quasi-split torus is rational. For a permutation 
$G$-lattice $L$ and any subgroup $H\leq G$, since $L\downarrow_H^G$ is a permutation 
lattice, the corresponding torus to $L\downarrow_H^G$ is rational. In other words a 
quasi split torus is hereditarily rational. Simillarly by Theorem \ref{SignPermRational} 
and above argument for (a sign permutation lattice), we conclude that any algebraic 
torus with a sign permutation character lattice is hereditarily rational. \\ \\

In particular this is true for an algebraic torus with character lattice the root 
lattice $\Z B_n$ as an $W(B_n)$-lattice. It is also known that any rank $n$ sign 
permutation lattice, is isomorphic to the restriction of $\Z B_n$ to a subgroup 
of $W(B_n)$. 
\begin{proposition}\cite[Proposition 1.5]{Lenstra}
Suppose $P$ is a permutation projective $G$-lattice and $G$ is the Galois group 
of a finite Galois extension, $K/F$. If 
$$0 \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow P \longrightarrow 0 $$ is 
an exact sequence of $G$-lattices, then the fields $K(L)^G$ and $K(M \oplus P)^G$ are isomorphic over $F$. 
\end{proposition}
\noindent
One can use the above proposition and Theorem \ref{NoNameLemma} to conclude the 
following theorem.
\begin{theorem}\cite[Proposition 1.6]{Lenstra}\label{method2}
Suppose $P$ is a permutation $G$-lattice and $G$ is the Galois group of a finite 
Galois extension, $K/F$.  If 
$$0 \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow P \longrightarrow 0 $$ is 
an exact sequence of $G$-lattices, then $K(L)^G$ is rational over $K(M)^G$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
An important corollary of the above theorem will be used frequently in chapter 3, 
in order to prove the rationality of algebraic tori.
\begin{corollary}\label{permcoker}
Suppose $P$ is a permutation $G$-lattice and $G$ is the Galois group of a finite 
Galois extension, $K/F$.  If $$0 \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow P \longrightarrow 0 $$ 
is an exact sequence of $G$-lattices and $K(M)^G$ is rational over $F$, then $K(L)^G$ is rational over $F$.
\end{corollary}
\noindent
In \cite[Section 2.4.8]{Voskresenskii} the author has shown that any algebraic 
torus with an augmentation ideal lattice is hereditarily rational. More precisely 
let $T$ be an algebraic torus defined over $F$ and splits over $K$ and $G = \mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$. 
Assume the character lattice of $T$ is $I_X$ (the kernel of the augmentation map), 
and $\Z [X]$ is a $G$-permuattion lattice, where 
\begin{equation}\label{Chevalley}
0 \longrightarrow I_X \longrightarrow \Z [X] \overset{\varepsilon} \longrightarrow  \Z \longrightarrow 0
\end{equation}
is an exact sequence and $\varepsilon : \Z [X]  \rightarrow \Z $, $x \rightarrow 1$ 
is the augmentation map. The exact sequence (\ref{Chevalley}) corresponds to the exact 
sequence of $F$ algebraic tori
$$0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{G}_m \longrightarrow R_{K_1/F}(\mathbb{G}_m) \times \cdots \times R_{K_t/F}(\mathbb{G}_m) \longrightarrow  T \longrightarrow 0$$
where $K_i/F$ (for $i = 1, \ldots ,t $) are intermediate fields of $K/F$ and $K/K_i$ is 
Galois. Now $T = \prod^t_{i = 1}R_{K_i/F}(\mathbb{G}_m)/\mathbb{G}_m$ and is rational. 
We note that for any subgroup $H$ of $G$, ${I_X}\downarrow^G_H$ is also an augmentation 
ideal. Hence an algebraic tori with augmentation ideal character lattice is hereditarily 
rational.\\
\\
It is worth mentioning that passing to dual lattices in \ref{Chevalley} we get 
$$0 \longrightarrow \Z \longrightarrow \Z [X] \overset{\varepsilon} \longrightarrow  J_{X} \longrightarrow 0$$
where $J_{X}= I^{\ast}_X$ is called Chevalley module. The corresponding algebraic 
torus to $J_X$ has interesting properties and is called norm one torus. Chevalley 
was the first one who discovered that norm one torus is not necessarily rational. \\
\\
The following lemma was used in \cite{Nicole1} to show that a given $G$-lattice 
is isomorphic to $J_{G/H}$.
\begin{lemma}\cite[Remark 4.1]{Nicole1}
Let $L$ be a $G$-lattice. If there exist $x\in L$ such that,
\begin{itemize}
\item $\langle G.x \rangle_{\Z} = L$
\item $\mathrm{Stab}_G(x) = H$
\item $\sum_{g \in G}gx = 0$,
\end{itemize}
then $L \cong J_{G/H}$.
\end{lemma}

\section{Reduction Algorithms}
Assume $$0 \rightarrow M  \rightarrow L_G \rightarrow N \rightarrow 0$$ is a short 
exact sequence of $G$-lattices such that $N$ is a permutation projective $G$-lattice. 
If $K/F$ is a finite Galois extension with $G \cong \mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$, then by 
Theorem (\ref{method2}), $K(L_G)^G$ is rational over $K(M)^G$. Thus, rationality 
of $K(M)^G$ over $F$ implies rationality of $K(L_G)^G$ over $F$.\\
\\
Suppose $L_G$ is an indecomposable $G$-lattice. In this section, we present methods 
to examine the possibility of existence of such a short exact sequence for $L_G$, with
 $N$ a permutation $G$-lattice.\\
\\
Although sign permutation lattices are not permutation projective, constructing a 
short exact sequence of $G$-lattices $$0 \rightarrow M  \rightarrow L_G \rightarrow N \rightarrow 0$$ 
where $N$ is a rank one sign permutation $G$-lattice might help to determine 
rationality of the associated algebraic torus to $L_G$. Note that existence of 
such a sequence does not directly imply rationality. However, under some conditions 
the rationality may be concluded. \\
\\
The goal of this section is to provide tools to get exact sequences mentioned above 
for a given indecomposable $G$-lattice. The idea behind all of the methods is a simple 
fact which we explain briefly here.  \\
\\
A lattice $L_G$, is reducible as a $G$-lattice if and only if $\Q L_G = L_G \otimes_{\Z} \Q$ 
has a proper $\Q[G]$-submodule $W$ of dimension $0 < m < n$. Let $L_G$ be a $G$-lattice of 
rank $n$ and $W$ is an $m$ dimensional proper $\Q[G]$-submodule of $\Q L_G$. Then $L_G \cap W$ 
is a sublattice of $L_G$ of rank $m$ such that $\Q (L_G \cap W) = W$. Then

$$0 \rightarrow L_G \cap W  \rightarrow L_G \rightarrow L_G/(L_G \cap W) \rightarrow 0$$
 is a short exact sequence of $G$-lattices. Note that this implies in particular that $L_G/(L_G \cap W)$ 
 is torsion free so that a $\Z$-basis of $L_G \cap W$ can be extended to a $\Z$-basis of $L_G$.\\
\\
In the next paragraphs we are specifically looking for an $n-1$ dimensional proper 
$\Q[G]$-submodule of $\Q L_G$.\\
\\
If we start with the dual lattice $L^*_G$, and we are able to find a rank 1 permutation 
sublattice of $L^*_G$, we get $$0 \rightarrow \Z  \rightarrow L^*_G \rightarrow M \rightarrow 0,$$ 
where $M = L^*_G/\Z$ is of rank $n-1$. Then by dualizing the sequence we have 
$$0 \rightarrow M^*  \rightarrow L_G \rightarrow \Z \rightarrow 0$$ as desired.
 \\
\\
Now, we explain how to find a permutation rank one sublattice of $L^*_G$. In order 
to get a one dimensional $\Q[G]$-submodule of $\Q L^*_G$, we use the eigenspaces of 
the transposes of a generating set of $G$. Let  $\lbrace \sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_m\rbrace$ 
be the transposes of a generating set of $G$ and let  $G^* = \langle \sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_m\rangle$. 
Suppose $E_{1,\sigma_i}$ is the left nullspace of $\sigma_i-I$ over $\Q$. 
We define $$E_1 = E_{1,\sigma_1}\cap \cdots \cap E_{1,\sigma_n}. $$
Note that $G^*$ acts trivially on $E_1$. If $E_1\neq {0}$ then we can choose a 
nonzero vector $u \in E_1$. Let $u = (\frac{a_1}{b_1}, \frac{a_2}{b_2}, \ldots , \frac{a_n}{b_n})\in E_1$ 
such that $\gcd(a_i, b_i) = 1$. If $m = \mathrm{lcm}(b_1, \ldots, b_n)$ then 
$m u = (a'_1, \ldots, a'_n) \in\Z^n$. If $\gcd (a'_1, \ldots, a'_n) = d$ then 
$v =\frac{m}{d} u \in L_G \cap E_1$ and the $\gcd$ of its entries is 1. \\
\\
As a consequence, we can extend $\lbrace v \rbrace$ to a $\Z$-basis of $L^*_G$. 
A general algorithm to do this extension is given by Magliveras et al in 
\cite{LatticeBase}; GAP also has a function which does the job. In most of the 
cases that we will see in the next section, $v$ had a $\pm 1$ as an entry, which makes 
the basis extension so simple: if $v_j$ is $\pm 1$ then 
$\lbrace e_1, \ldots , e_{j-1}, e_{j+1}, \ldots, e_n , v \rbrace$ forms a $\Z$-basis for $L^*_G$.\\
\\  
Since it is possible to extend $v$ to a basis for the lattice $L^*_G$, there exists a change of basis matrix $T$ in $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ such that
$$T \sigma_i T^{-1} = \left[ \begin{array}{c|c}
\delta_i & \ast\\
\hline 0 & 1
\end{array} \right]
$$ 
for some $\delta_i \in \mathrm{GL}(n-1,\Z).$ Since we consider the finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ up to conjugacy, we can work with $G' = TG^*T^{-1}$. By considering the first $n-1$ vectors of the standard basis of the $G'$-lattice $L_{G'}$ (which is isomorphic to $L^*_G$), can form the $G'$-lattice $M$ such that $L_{G'}/\Z = M$ and we get 
$$0 \longrightarrow \Z \longrightarrow L_{G'} \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow 0.$$
By dualizing the sequence we get  $$0 \longrightarrow M^* \longrightarrow L^*_{G'} \longrightarrow \Z \longrightarrow 0.$$
Note that $L^*_{G'}$ is isomorphic to $L_G$.\\
\\
The explained method above is presented as an algorithm here.

\begin{remark}
If the algorithm returns a matrix $T$ then for $\sigma \in \lbrace \sigma^t_1, \ldots , \sigma^t_m \rbrace$, 
$$T \sigma T^{-1} = \sigma'$$ where $$\sigma' = \left[ \begin{array}{c|c}
\delta & \ast \\
\hline
0 &1 
\end{array}\right]. 
$$
for some $\delta \in \mathrm{GL}(n-1, \Z)$. More precisely $$T \sigma = \sigma'T$$ and the last row of $T \sigma$ is nothing but $v \sigma = v$. This implies that the last row of $\sigma' = [0 \,\, \ldots \,\, 0 \,\, 1]$.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
Let $G\leq \mathrm{GL}(4,\Z)$ be generated by 
$$ \left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 0&-1&0&0\\ -1&-1&-1&-1
\\ 1&1&1&0\\ 1&1&0&1\end {array}
 \right] 
\tand
\left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 0&1&0&0\\ -1&0&0&0
\\ 0&-1&0&-1\\ 0&-1&-1&0
\end {array} \right].
$$
The transposes are 
$$
 \sigma = \left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 0&-1&1&1\\ -1&-1&1&1
\\ 0&-1&1&0\\ 0&-1&0&1\end {array}
 \right]
 \tand 
\tau =  \left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 0&-1&0&0\\ 1&0&-1&-1
\\ 0&0&0&-1\\ 0&0&-1&0\end {array}
 \right].
$$ 
Then the $E_{1,\sigma}$ is the left nullspace of $\sigma - I_4$.
One can verify that 
\begin{displaymath}
\lbrace \begin{bmatrix}
1& -1 &1 &0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
1& -1 &0 &1
\end{bmatrix}
\rbrace
\end{displaymath}
is a basis for $E_{1,\sigma}$. Similarly $E_{1,\tau}$ is the left nullspace of $\tau - I_4$
 which is generated by $\begin{bmatrix}
0& 0 &-1 &1
\end{bmatrix}$.\\
\\It is not hard to see $\begin{bmatrix}
0& 0 &-1 &1
\end{bmatrix}\in E_{1,\sigma}$. Thus $$E_1 = E_{1,\sigma} \cap E_{1,\tau} = \langle \begin{bmatrix}
0& 0 &-1 &1
\end{bmatrix} \rangle$$
and $ \begin{bmatrix}
0& 0 &-1 &1
\end{bmatrix}\in L$. Now $$\lbrace  \begin{bmatrix}
1& 0 &0 &0
\end{bmatrix} ,  \begin{bmatrix}
0& 1 &0 &0
\end{bmatrix},  \begin{bmatrix}
0& 0 &1 &0
\end{bmatrix},  \begin{bmatrix}
0& 0 &-1 &1
\end{bmatrix} \rbrace$$ forms a $\Z$-basis for $L$. The change of basis matrix $T$ is 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 &0 &0\\
0 & 1 &0 &0\\
0 & 0 &1 &0\\
0 & 0 &-1 &1
\end{bmatrix}
$$ Hence 
$$
T \sigma T^{-1}= \left[ \begin {array}{ccc|c} 0&-1&2&1\\ -1&-1&2&1
\\ 0&-1&1&0\\ \hline 0&0&0&1\end {array}
 \right], \,\,\,
T\tau T^{-1}=  \left[ \begin {array}{ccc|c} 0&-1&0&0\\ 1&0&-2&-1
\\ 0&0&-1&-1\\ \hline 0&0&0&1\end {array}
 \right] 
$$
Now by dualizing we get 
$$
 \left[ \begin {array}{ccc|c} 0&-1&0&0\\ -1&-1&-1&0
\\ 2&2&1&0\\ \hline 1&1&0&1\end {array}
 \right]
 \tand 
 \left[ \begin {array}{ccc|c} 0&1&0&0\\ -1&0&0&0
\\ 0&-2&-1&0\\ \hline 0&-1&-1&1
\end {array} \right] 
$$ 
as a generating set for a conjugate of $G$. By defining $M\subset L_G$ generated by $e_1, e_2$ and $e_3$ the following exact sequence will be obtained
$$
0 \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow L_G \longrightarrow \Z \longrightarrow 0
$$ 
\end{example}
\noindent
We call the above process the fixed point algorithm. One can generalize it as follows. Assume $E_{\lambda,\sigma}$ be the left kernel of $\sigma-\lambda I$ over the  rationals. Now define $E_{\pm 1,\sigma}$ to be  the set $\lbrace E_{1,\sigma}, E_{-1,\sigma}\rbrace$. Assume $E_{\pm 1, G}$ is the Cartesian product of $E_{\pm1, \sigma}$ for all $\sigma \in G^*$, i.e. 
$$E_{\pm 1,G} = E_{\pm 1, \sigma_1} \times \cdots \times E_{\pm 1, \sigma_n}.$$ 
If there exist $A\in E_{\pm 1,  G}$ such that $W = \bigcap\limits_{B \in A} B \neq 0$, then we can find a nonzero $v \in L^*_G \cap W$. As we have seen in the fixed point algorithm, we can extend a multiple of $v$ to a $\Z$-basis for $L^*_G$. Then we can get a change of basis matrix $T$, such that 
$$T \sigma_i T^{-1} = \left[ \begin{array}{c|c}
\delta_i & \ast\\
\hline
0 & \pm 1
\end{array}\right]
$$ 
for some $\delta_i \in \mathrm{GL}(n-1,\Z).$ Thus by a similar argument we can use the new representative of the conjugacy class of $G^*$ to form an equivalent lattice and similarly by choosing the first $n-1$ elements of the standard basis of $L_{G'}$ we can produce 
$$0 \longrightarrow \Z^- \longrightarrow L_{G'} \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow 0.$$
By dualizing the sequence we get 
$$0 \longrightarrow M^* \longrightarrow L^*_{G'} \longrightarrow \Z^- \longrightarrow 0.$$
Again note that $L^*_{G'}$ is isomorphic to $L_G$.\\

This process will be called the sign fixed point algorithm and it is presented as an algorithm here.

\begin{example}
Let $G\leq \mathrm{GL}(4,\Z)$ be generated by
$$
\left[ \begin {array}{cccc} -1&1&0&1\\ 0&0&0&1
\\ -1&0&1&1\\ 0&1&0&0\end {array}
 \right] 
\tand
\left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 0&1&0&0\\ 0&0&1&0
\\ 0&0&0&-1\\ -1&1&0&1\end {array}
 \right].
$$ 
The transposes are
$$
\sigma = \left[ \begin {array}{cccc} -1&0&-1&0\\ 1&0&0&1
\\ 0&0&1&0\\ 1&1&1&0\end {array}
 \right] 
\tand 
\tau =  \left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 0&0&0&-1\\ 1&0&0&1
\\ 0&1&0&0\\ 0&0&-1&1\end {array}
 \right].
$$ 
By computing the left nullspaces ($\sigma \pm I_4$ and $\tau \pm I_4$) we get 
$$E_{1,\sigma} =\langle [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 1, 1, 0, 1 ] \rangle, \,\,\, 
E_{-1,\sigma} =\langle [ [ 2, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 1, -1, 0, 1 ] ] \rangle $$
$$E_{1,\tau} =\langle [ -1, -1, -1, 1 ]  \rangle, \,\,\,
E_{-1,\tau} =\langle [ 1, -1, 1, 1 ]\rangle. $$
So 
$$ E_{1,\sigma} \cap E_{1,\tau}= {0}, \,\,\,
 E_{1,\sigma} \cap E_{-1,\tau}= {0} $$
$$ E_{-1,\sigma} \cap E_{1,\tau}= \langle [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ] \rangle, \,\,\,
 E_{-1,\sigma} \cap E_{-1,\tau}= {0}. $$
Let $W = E_{-1,\sigma} \cap E_{1,\tau}.$ So $[ 1, 1, 1, -1 ] \in L \cap W$ is extendable to a basis for $L$ by vectors 
$$[ 1, 0, 0, 0 ] \, , \, [ 0,1,0,0 ] \tand [ 0,0,1,0] $$
and the corresponding transformation is 
$$
T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 1 & 1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
\sigma' = T\sigma T^{-1} = \left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 0&1&-1&-1\\ 1&0&1&0
\\ 0&0&1&1\\ 0&0&0&-1\end {array}
 \right] 
, \,\,\,
\tau' = T \tau T^{-1} =\left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 0&0&-1&0\\ 1&0&1&0
\\ 1&1&0&-1\\ 0&0&0&1\end {array}
 \right].
$$
Now by dualizing we get 
$$
 \left[ \begin {array}{ccc|c} 0&1&0&0\\ 1&0&0&0
\\ -1&1&1&0\\ \hline -1&0&1&-1
\end {array} \right]
 \tand 
 \left[ \begin {array}{ccc|c} 0&1&1&0\\ 0&0&1&0
\\ -1&1&0&0\\ \hline 0&0&-1&1\end {array}
 \right] 
$$ 
as a generating set for a conjugate of $G$. By defining $M\subset L_G$ generated by $e_1, e_2$ and $e_3$ the following exact sequence will be obtained
$$0 \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow L_G \longrightarrow \Z^- \longrightarrow 0.$$
\end{example}

\noindent
In general to get a $\Q[G]$-submodule $W$ of $\Q L$, where $L = L_G$ is a $G$-lattice, one can use the decomposition of $\Q L$ (provided that it is decomposable). It is not always easy to find the decomposition of a $\Q[G]$-module. The most well-known tool for module decomposition is the meataxe algorithm. The algorithm was first introduced by Parker in \cite{Parker} in order to check irreducibility of a finite dimensional module over a finite field and finding explicit submodules in case of reducibility. Later on Parker extended the idea of the meataxe algorithm to characteristic zero (see \cite{Parker2}). His algorithm can be used to decompose an integral representation of a finite group. In \cite{Plesken2}, the authors provided machinery which enables us to decompose $\Q[G]$-modules up to dimension 200. So there are algorithms which give the decomposition over $\Q$. We invite the reader to see \cite{Lux} and \cite{Holt} for more details. \\
\\
Assume $G \leq \mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ is finite and $\Q L = L \otimes_{\Z} \Q$ is the $\Q$-vector corresponding space to $L$. If $\Q L$ is a decomposable $\Q[G]$-module, then there exists a change of basis matrix such that generators of the $\Q$-class of $G$ can be written as block diagonal matrices
$$
T \sigma_i T^{-1} =  \left[ \begin{array}{c|c}
\delta_i & 0 \\
\hline
0 & \gamma_i
\end{array} \right]
$$
where $\delta_i	\in \mathrm{GL}(m,\Q)$ and $ \gamma_i \in \mathrm{GL}(m',\Q)$ for some $m, m' \in \Z$. Let $\lbrace e_1, \ldots, e_m, e_{m+1}, \ldots , e_{m+m'}\rbrace$ be the standard basis for $\Q L$. The $\Q M$ and $\Q N$ generated respectively by $\lbrace e_1, \ldots, e_m \rbrace$ and 
$\lbrace e_{m+1}, \ldots , e_{m+m'} \rbrace$ are invariant (set wise) under the action of $G$ and $\Q L = \Q M \oplus \Q N$. Now $T^{-1}(\Q M)$ is a $G$-stable subspace and $$M = L \cap T^{-1}(\Q M) $$ is $G$ stable. Then we get 
$$0 \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow L/M \longrightarrow 0$$
as an exact sequence of lattices.\\
\\
The above idea can be turned into an algorithm. In order to do so, one need to compute the decomposition of $\Q L$ (meataxe or any other algorithm can be applied). If in the previous step the change of basis, namely $T$, to get the decomposition is not computed, it should be done next. The next step is to choose a component of the decomposition, say $\Q M$ and a basis of it. After that, $M = T^{-1}(\Q M) \cap L$ is a sublattice of $L$. The last step is to extend a basis of $M$ to $L$ (see \cite{LatticeBase} for an algorithm). \\
\\

Here is an example which shows the above idea in practice. The $\Q$-class of the group is presented from the list of $\Q$-classes in rank $4$ provided in \cite{Hoshi}.
\begin{example}\label{exmp:Decompose}
Consider the group $G$ generated by 
% [4,149,1]
$$
\sigma = \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
 \tand
\tau = \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
-1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right].
$$
The $\Q$-class of $G$ is accessible in the list of rank 4 groups in \cite{Hoshi} by the name cryst4[149]. The generators of the $\Q$-class are
$$
\sigma' =\left[\begin{array}{rrr|rr}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
 \tand
\tau' = \left[\begin{array}{rrr|rr}
1 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & -1
\end{array}\right].
$$
Considering the orders of matrices we can figure out there exist an invertible integral matrix $T$ such that 
$$T\sigma T^{-1}= \sigma'$$
$$T\tau T^{-1} = \tau'.$$
Assume 25 indeterminates $t_{00}  ,\ldots , t_{44}$ and the matrix
$$
T =\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
t_{00} & t_{01} & t_{02} & t_{03} & t_{04} \\
t_{10} & t_{11} & t_{12} & t_{13} & t_{14} \\
t_{20} & t_{21} & t_{22} & t_{23} & t_{24} \\
t_{30} & t_{31} & t_{32} & t_{33} & t_{34} \\
t_{40} & t_{41} & t_{42} & t_{43} & t_{44}
\end{array}\right].
$$
Then 
$$
T\sigma= \sigma' T^{-1}
, \,\,\,
T\tau= \tau' T^{-1}
$$
The transformation $T$ can be found by solving (and replacing parameters) the linear system obtained from above equations as
$$
T =\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
-1 & 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\
-1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & -1 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\
1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\
1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right].
$$
Let $\Q M = \langle e_1, e_2 , e_3 \rangle_\Q$.
Hence $T^{-1}(\Q M) = \langle   \left[-\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{1}{4},\,-\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{3}{4}\right], \left[-\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{1}{4},\,-\frac{1}{4},\,-\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{1}{4}\right],  \left[-\frac{1}{4},\,-\frac{1}{4},\,-\frac{1}{4},\,-\frac{1}{4},\,-\frac{1}{4}\right]\rangle_\Q .$
Now
$$M = L \cap T^{-1}(\Q M) = \langle \left[\begin{array}{ccccc}1&0&1&0&-1\end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right], \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right] \rangle_\Z$$ 
By extending the above basis of $M$ to a basis of $L$ (by adding $[0,0,1,0,0]$ and $[0,0,0,0,1]$) and forming the change of basis matrix we get 
$$
S =  \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
$$
 which gives 
$$
 S
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
S^{-1}
= 
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|rr}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$
$$
 S
\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
-1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
S^{-1}
= 
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|rr}
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1
\end{array}\right]
$$
Now we can get the following exact sequence of lattices 
$$0 \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow L/M \longrightarrow 0.$$ 
\end{example}

\section{Results}\label{conc}
The 18 maximal indecomposable stably rational lattices found in \cite{Hoshi} are divided into 4 families. The first family are the ones interpreted as lattices of root systems which are hereditarily rational. The second family contains all lattices on which Algorithm \ref{alg:Fixed Point} will not fail. The third family contains lattices on which  Algorithm \ref{alg:Sign Fixed Point} does not fail while Algorithm \ref{alg:Fixed Point} fails. The last family contains all lattices on which either, both Algorithms \ref{alg:Fixed Point} and \ref{alg:Sign Fixed Point} fail but still the general idea of reduction works, or they are irreducible.\\
\\
All lattices of the first family are hereditarily rational. The second family contains lattices of which after reduction, rationality of the reduced component is unknown. By arguments in the previous sections we have proved the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
The groups presented in Table \ref{Tbl:Rational} are hereditarily rational.

\noindent
The exceptional cases of the second family are presented in Table \ref{Tbl:RationalityUnknown}. In each case the reduced component is stably rational as proved in \cite{Hoshi}. Their rationality is unknown yet. In \cite{Nicole1} the author has proved that subgroups of $[ 4, 25, 8, 5 ]$ are rational except for possibly $$[4, 6, 2, 11], [4, 12, 4, 13], [4, 13, 2, 6], [4, 13, 3, 6], [4, 13, 7, 12], [4, 24, 4, 6], [4, 25, 4, 5], [4, 25, 8, 5].$$
There will be precisely one subgroup of $G_{14}$ with each of the dimension 4 reduced components in the above list, so except for possibly those subgroups of $G_{14}$ the rest are rational. The exceptional cases are presented in Table \ref{ExceptionalG14}.\\
\\
From the above list $$[4, 6, 2, 11], [4, 12, 4, 13], [4, 13, 2, 6], [4, 13, 3, 6], [4, 13, 7, 12]$$ are subgroups of $[4, 13, 7, 12]$ which means we have the same problem for cases $G_{17}$ and $G_{18}$. Hence except for possibly the subgroups of $G_{17}$ and $G_{18}$ associated to above list their rest of subgroups are rational. For the exceptional cases see Table \ref{ExceptionalG17} and Table \ref{ExceptionalG18}.

\noindent
There are 4 cases, namely $G_4, G_5,G_6$ and $G_{11}$, in which after the reduction we get a rank one sign permutation lattice (more information is given in Table \ref{SignPerm}). The same also happened in some subgroups of irreducible lattices (see Table \ref{SubIrreducible}). It is possible that these groups are hereditarily rational, but we do not currently have a proof. One possible approach to prove rationality in these cases may be the following argument.\\
\\
%Assume $L$ is a lattice in the third family, that is, there exists an exact sequence of lattices such that

%Suppose $K/F$ is a finite Galois extension and $G = \mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$. We note that by the No Name Lemma we obtain $K(P)^G = K(y_1, \ldots , y_t)$ and $K(M)^G = F(x_1, \ldots , x_{n-1})$ is implied by rationality of $M$. Now if there exist a permutation lattice $Q'$ such that $P \subset M \oplus Q'$ (or even if $L\subset M \oplus Q'$) then $K(L)^G \subset K(M)(Q')^G$ which implies unirationality of $K(L)^G$ over $K(M)^G$. Now L\"{u}roth's theorem implies rationality of $K(L)^G$ over $F$.

For the last family we have considered their maximal subgroups and we could not decide about the rationality of the groups presented in the following table.
\begin{theorem}\label{SubG8}
All groups in Table \ref{IrreducibleSubs} are hereditarily rational. That is, all subgroups of $G_8$, $G_9$, $G_{10}$ and $G_{15}$ except for possibly the subgroups in Table \ref{SubIrreducible} are hereditarily rational.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
A proof of Theorem \ref{SubG8} is provided in Appendix A.

\begin{remark}
The union of the set of groups in Table \ref{SubIrreducible} and the set of subgroups of the groups in Table \ref{IrreducibleSubs}, is the set of all subgroups of $G_8, G_9, G_{10}$ and $G_{15}$.
\end{remark}
Appendix B presents tables of conjugacy classes of indecomposable subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(5,\Z)$ which correspond to stably rational tori of dimension 5 from Hoshi and Yamasaki's list. From this list, those stably rational tori of dimension 5 whose rationality is unknown are listed.
